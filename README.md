## ⭐ Top 5 Differentiators

1. **System Architect, not just Lab Builder**  
   - Designs end‑to‑end platforms (Veridion™, ChainLogic™) with jurisdictional routing, immutable ledgers, and compliance gates.  
   - Goes beyond configs to deliver forensic‑grade systems.

2. **Audit‑Grade Documentation**  
   - Produces READMEs, matrices, and governance scaffolding that align with NIST 800‑53 and legal standards.  
   - Every repo doubles as a portfolio artifact.

3. **Firewall & Hardening Expertise**  
   - pfSense segmentation, iptables persistence, custom systemd restore, STIG‑aligned hardening.  
   - Demonstrates Zero Trust enforcement and reproducibility discipline.

4. **Privacy‑First Design**  
   - DeepSee™ detection runs fully on‑device with no cloud storage.  
   - FloodFactorApp and civic map enforce opt‑in data flows and secure‑by‑default interaction models.

5. **Operational Maturity**  
   - Ships production‑grade deployments (Flask apps, Render hosting, civic maps).  
   - Integrates automation (Ansible, PowerShell) and telemetry (Wazuh, ELK) for reliability and evidence capture.
